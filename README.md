# Computer_Graphic_Drawing_Algorithms
representation of some computer graphic drawing algorithms  by c++ 

you can make the following functions on white window that interact with terminal and hand cursor to use program 

-Choose color for drawing 
-Draw line by different algorithms [DDA, Midpoint and parametric]
-Draw Circle by different algorithms (Direct, Polar, iterative Polar, midpoint and modified Midpoint)
-Filling Circle with lines after taking filling quarter from user
-Filling Circle with other circles after taking filling quarter from user 
-Filling Square with Hermit Curve[Vertical]
-Filling Rectangle with Bezier Curve[horizontal]
-Convex and Non Convex Filling Algorithm
-Do Recursive and Non Recursive Flood Fill
-Draw Cardinal Spline Curve
-Draw ellipse Algorithms [Direct, polar and midpoint]
-Clipping algorithms using Rectangle as Clipping Window[Point ,Line, Polygon]
-Clipping algorithms using Square as Clipping Window[Point ,Line]
-Clipping algorithms using circle as a Clipping Window [Point, Line]
-Save all data in screen
-Load data from files
-Clear screen from shapes


to use program correctly :
every shape need 2 clicks the first is left click and the second is right 
every shape take more than 2 points use right clicks 
flood fill is require 2 right click to draw shape and third to fill 
fill by circle require to clicks but if you wanna use fill option choose it and then choose which shape you wanna fill and draw it 
clipping is amazing but special firstly draw shape by double right click and then draw on shape 
you can run app on any ide that support win32
